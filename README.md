# Acedium

Acedium is a (neo)forge port of [Nvidium](https://modrinth.com/mod/nvidium). 
Nvidium is an alternate rendering backing for sodium, it uses cutting edge nvidia features to render huge amounts of
terrain geometry at very playable framerates.

The name comes from the latin Acedia (as nvidia comes from the latin Invidia meaning "envy"), which means "negligence" or "sloth". 
I've chosen this name to reflect that this is a lazy/lacking port, which does not contribute back to the original project, 
or improves the (neo)forge compatibility. For that reason, I'm not planning on releasing this beyond a possible github release.

### Requires sodium and an nvidia gtx 1600 series or newer to run (turing+ architecture)
